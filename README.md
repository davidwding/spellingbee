# Collaborative Spelling Bee

This is my attempt at making a collaborative version of the New York Times' Spelling Bee game.

Tasks for v1:

- [ ] Write a cronjob to automatically pull the latest Spelling Bee every day
- [ ] Write a backend that tracks daily progress
- [ ] Write a frontend that communicates with the backend using WebSockets
